1. Atoms of radioactive elements can split. According to Albert Einstein, mass and energy are interchangeable under certain circumstances. When atoms split, the process is called nuclear fission. In this case, a small amount of mass is converted into energy. Thus the energy released cannot do much damage. However, several subatomic particles called neutrons are also emitted during this process. Each neutron will hit a radioactive element releasing more neutrons in the process. This causes a chain reaction and creates a large amount of energy. This energy is converted into heat which expands uncontrollably causing an explosion. Hence, atoms do not literally explode. They generate energy that can cause explosions.

2. Everyone knows that paper is made from trees. But when one looks at trees, one cannot imagine that something so soft and fragile as the paper is made is so hard and strong. Plant materials such as wood are made of fibres known as cellulose. It is the primary ingredient in paper making. Raw wood is first converted into pulp consisting of a mixture of Cellulose, lignin, water and some chemicals. The pulp can be made mechanically through grinders or through chemical processes. Short fibres are produced by mechanical grinding. The paper produced in this way is weak and is used to make newspapers, magazines and phonebooks.

3. Gardening is my favourite hobby. I own a small plot of land next to our house. I cultivate gardening there. Every day, I spend half an hour gardening. After returning from my morning walk, I go to my garden with a spade and a bucket of water. I prepare the soil, prune the plants, and water them. I also use insecticides and fertilisers. My heart leaps with joy when I see the plants swaying in the wind. I feel heavenly pleasure as I watch them grow day by day.

4. Home is the place where we return to rest after a day’s work, and where parents and children meet together and have a carefree and joyful time.

I am the most important member of the family. Everyone trusts my judgement and agrees to follow my suggestions.

11. The Dowry system is bad in society. It has turned the sacred matter of marriage into a business deal. The bride is regarded as a marketable commodity. Bride’s parents are often put under inhumane pressure for a handsome dowry. Sometimes they become destitute to give their daughters in marriage. In many cases, young brides are brutally tortured or pushed to commit suicide. To eliminate this social evil, a complete change in society’s outlook is necessary.

Rainwater softens the soil and makes it suitable for cultivation. Monsoon has some disadvantages. Due to heavy and incessant rainfall, the roads, especially in villages, become muddy.

Even monks have friends. I also have friends. Peter is my close friend. He is my friend since childhood. He comes from a poor family. But he is very talented. My next best friend is Lisa. She is a complete foil to Peter. She is the son of a big man. She is neither intelligent nor industrious. She often goes out hunting birds with a gun. I have some other friends. They are John, Nisha and Camellia.

15. Co-education is an educational system in which boys and girls attend the same school or college. Co-education was uncommon in ancient times. It is a radical concept. Parents supported the case for adequate education for all children, regardless of gender. The countrymen realised that in the free world, boys and girls must move together and work hand in hand in all aspects of life. They began sending their children to co-educational schools. Co-education encourages competition among boys and girls through the activities they participate in at school. That is why students at co-educational institutions perform better in all aspects of their lives.
